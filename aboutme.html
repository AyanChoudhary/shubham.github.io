            <p class="para">I am a first year undergraduate Civil Engineering student at Indian Institute of Technology, Roorkee.<br><br>
        
            I grew up in Bhopal and did my schooling from Kendriya Vidyalaya No. 2, Bhopal. I learned about Java,mySQL from the school curriculum itself! But I exploited the internet and learned HTML, CSS, and much more!
            <br><br>
            My personal interests are web development, competitive programming, network     security, cooking (as
            well as eating), badminton, table tennis and gaming.
            <br><br>
            I am a developer at SDSLabs, an awesome group of students constantly striving to innovate and foster technical
            activities at IIT Roorkee.
            <br><br>
            Apart from technical activities, I play badminton and table tennis.<br></p>
